🏦 Console-Based Banking System (Python)

This project is a console-based banking management system built using Python, focusing on procedural programming, file handling, and core security concepts.

The system allows users to create and manage bank accounts through a simple command-line interface, with all account data stored persistently using JSON files.

✨ Key Features

Create a new bank account with a unique auto-generated ID

Secure login system with custom password encryption & decryption

Deposit and withdraw money with proper validation

Real-time balance checking

Detailed transaction history with timestamps

Change account password securely

Close/delete an account with confirmation

Persistent data storage using JSON

Input validation and error handling for a smooth user experience

🧠 Concepts Used

Procedural programming in Python

File handling (read/write using JSON)

Custom encryption logic

Functions and modular code structure

Recursion (for unique ID generation)

Exception handling (try-except)

Basic decorators for enhanced user feedback

Date & time handling for transaction logs

🎯 Purpose

This project was built to strengthen fundamental Python skills such as logic building, data persistence, and security awareness, while avoiding heavy frameworks or databases.

It serves as a strong foundation for transitioning into more advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming, databases, and backend development.
